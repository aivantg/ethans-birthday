    <!--
    You solved the first puzzle! Now that wasn't so bad, right?
    Welcome to the scavenger hunt made JUST for coders! Only true coders
    will be able to make it to the end. Are you a true coder? Here are the rules:

    1. Every puzzle will take place on its own subdomain aka: puzzle.codersonly.club
    2. Every puzzle will have a clue that you are trying to find. once you find the clue,
       use it as your next subdomain! Eg. clue.codersonly.club
    3. If you ever get stuck, check out <puzzle_name>.codersonly.club/hints.html For some hints.
    4. If there's an error on a page, it's probably meant to be there ;)
    5. Don't guess domain names! Play the game fairly
    6. If you don't mind, screen record so we can see your reactions to riddles :)
    7. Good luck! Your first riddle: "What should designers do?"

    See you at the finish line! <3
