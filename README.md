# ethans-birthday

A scavenger hunt for everyone's favorite coder held at [www.codersonly.club](www.codersonly.club)!
Every puzzle is meant to lead to a clue that is the name of the next subdomain. You can find them all at puzzlename.codersonly.club!

Planning Doc for more info: [here!](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Hey-anyone-wanna-smoke--ATgMdTqXBM7YcwWXmGy8QLyCAQ-hsPK7BSWnHd0ZXaOWoQVD)


The intended order was: 

1. wwww
2. design
3. eggsandwich (in person search)
4. dizzy
5. typer (linked to ethan's typeracer)
6. coders (takes you to a coffee shop where he had to ask for the clue)
7. ill
8. nothotdog
9. nerd
10. jaijeet
11. soondooboo
12. arson (final in-person surprise!)

All of them are easy to try (except for the ones in parentheses)
Happy Birthday Ethan!
